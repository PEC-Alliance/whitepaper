As the world strives to decarbonize the electricity grid and meet global climate targets, market instruments such as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) have been critical in promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources. However, the current REC market has limitations in fully capturing the impact of renewable energy projects on grid decarbonization, mainly because RECs focus on the renewable attribute of electricity generation rather than the actual emissions reductions achieved.

The carbon impact of a megawatt-hour of renewable generation varies significantly by location and time of day. For instance, a solar farm in a region with a coal-heavy grid mix can displace more emissions than a similar farm in a region with a cleaner grid mix. Similarly, a wind farm that generates power during peak demand hours can avoid more emissions than one that generates power during off-peak hours. Traditional RECs do not capture this variability, which assigns the same environmental attribute to all megawatt-hours of renewable generation, regardless of when and where they are produced.

To address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive solution for tracking and monetizing the environmental benefits of renewable energy generation, a new market instrument called Power Emissions Certificates (PECs) is being proposed. PECs aim to quantify and assign value to the avoided greenhouse gas emissions resulting from renewable energy projects, enabling a more accurate representation of their contributions to grid decarbonization. This whitepaper will explore the concept of PECs in detail, including their potential benefits and challenges and their relationship with the existing REC market.

By tokenizing avoided emissions, PECs leverage blockchain technology to establish a transparent and tamper-proof record of emissions reductions associated with renewable energy generation. This enhances the credibility and accuracy of emissions reporting while helping to prevent double counting and fraud.

PECs introduce a new, tradable instrument that can be bought and sold by various market participants, including renewable energy developers, utilities, and commercial and industrial customers. PECs offer a financial incentive for renewable energy generators to optimize emissions reductions by assigning a monetary value to avoided emissions, thereby furthering the development of projects which meaningfully displace the most carbon-intensive forms of electricity generation.
