# The Problem with RECs

## **The Limitations of Annual Energy Matching**

Annual energy matching, a common practice for organizations aiming to reach net-zero carbon emissions, relies heavily on the purchase and accounting of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). However, this approach, while valuable, presents significant limitations in truly mitigating an organization's environmental impact. The principal issue lies in the fact that merely matching the quantity of consumed electricity with RECs does not guarantee a reduction in carbon emissions at the times and locations where it is most needed.

The inherent variability of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, along with their non-coincident production with electricity demand, poses challenges. For instance, generating solar power during midday when demand might be low does not directly offset high carbon emissions during peak demand periods in the evening. Consequently, the carbon reduction value of RECs can vary dramatically based on the generation source's location, the timing of energy production, and the broader context of the regional power grid's characteristics​​.

## **Transmission Constraints and Low Power Prices**

The value of RECs also diminishes in regions where transmission constraints or low power prices prevail. In areas with transmission bottlenecks, additional renewable energy generated cannot be effectively transmitted to where it is needed most, often resulting in curtailment. This scenario renders the environmental benefits of such generation projects moot, as the potential to displace fossil fuel generation is lost due to physical limitations of the grid infrastructure .

Similarly, RECs produced in regions experiencing very low or even negative power prices, often due to oversupply of renewable energy, fail to contribute meaningfully to additional carbon emission reductions. These conditions typically indicate that the marginal generator on the grid is already a low- or zero-emissions source, implying that new renewable energy projects do not displace higher-emitting generation but rather add to the surplus of clean energy .

## **Towards a More Meaningful Impact**

To address these shortcomings, the concept of Locational Marginal Emissions (LMEs) has been proposed as a more nuanced and impactful approach. LMEs consider the specific carbon displacement value of renewable energy based on its location and the timing of generation. This methodology enables a more accurate assessment of the actual carbon reduction achieved through renewable energy projects, encouraging investments in areas where they can have the greatest environmental impact .

In conclusion, while RECs play a critical role in promoting renewable energy development, their effectiveness in achieving true net zero is constrained by the broader dynamics of the electricity grid, including transmission limitations and regional power market conditions. A shift towards evaluating and incentivizing renewable energy projects based on their locational and temporal carbon displacement value, as encapsulated by LMEs, represents a more targeted and effective strategy for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector.
