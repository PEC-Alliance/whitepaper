# Introduction

Power Emissions Certificates (PECs) are designed to overcome the limitations of the existing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) market. PECs are designed to quantify and assign value to the greenhouse gas emissions avoided due to renewable energy projects, thereby providing a more precise depiction of their contributions to grid decarbonization.

PECs, denominated in tons of carbon dioxide emissions, provide a direct financial incentive for renewable energy generation carbon impact, resulting in the most significant reductions. This means that PECs inherently encourage the development of renewable energy resources in locations and at times where they can have the most significant impact in terms of reducing emissions.

This innovative approach aligns the financial incentives of the market with the physical realities of the grid, supporting the broader goal of global climate action. It provides a more nuanced and effective way of addressing the concerns raised by stakeholders about the need for businesses to consume renewable energy in the same grid where it is generated.

The carbon impact of a megawatt-hour of renewable generation varies significantly by location and time of day. Traditional RECs do not capture this variability, which assigns the same environmental attribute to all megawatt-hours of renewable generation, regardless of when and where they are produced. PECs, on the other hand, provide a more accurate measure of the environmental impact of renewable energy generation.

The PEC platform adopts an innovative approach to carbon accounting known as carbon matching or impact-based carbon accounting. This method determines the carbon emissions based on the impact approach detailed previously. This method also follows the guidelines EmissionsFirst Partnership, which proposes to update the protocol with a new scope 2 emissions calculation approach considering the impact of location and temporality as key factors to achieve grid decarbonization.

The use of PECs is facilitated by a global registry, which provides a platform for issuing, transferring, and retiring PECs. This registry ensures the transparency, traceability, and integrity of PEC transactions, enhancing the credibility of the associated environmental claims. The registry also integrates with existing REC registries and tracking systems, allowing seamless coordination between market instruments.

In essence, PECs represent a significant advancement in the field of environmental market instruments. They provide a more comprehensive solution for tracking and monetizing the environmental benefits of renewable energy generation, thereby contributing to the global efforts to mitigate climate change and transition to a sustainable energy future.
